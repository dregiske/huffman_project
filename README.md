## Huffman Code Project in C++ Programming

My implementation of Huffman code using C++. It is a file compression and decompression using a Huffman Tree.

## Features
- File compression
- File uncompression
- Huffman Tree

## How to run
1. Clone or download project files.
2. Open terminal in project directory.
3. Compile program: ```make```
4. Run program with compression: ```./compress <input_filename> <output_filename>```
5. Run program with uncompression: ```./uncompress <compress_filename> <output_filename>```
6. Clean project directory: ```make clean```


## Usage
- Input a file to compress and an output file
- The program creates a new output file to store the compressed contents in
- Input the compressed file to uncompress it and an output file
- The program creates a new output file the same as the original input file
